# Proposal for Table of Content (TOC) Component Improvements

## 1. Main Proposal: Introduce Keyboard Navigation

To improve usability and accessibility, the TOC component should support keyboard navigation. This would include the following:

- **Expand/Collapse Nodes with Enter**: Allow users to expand or collapse nodes by pressing `Enter`. Refocus on the element with `Enter` after the action, maintaining the current behavior.
- **Arrow Key Navigation**: Use arrow keys for navigating between TOC items:
  - Up/Down arrows to move between sibling nodes.
  - Right arrow to expand a node, and Left arrow to collapse it (if applicable).
  - Special handling for expanded nodes to ensure smooth behavior.
- **ARIA Attributes for Accessibility**:
  - Add `aria-expanded` to dynamically indicate whether a node is expanded or collapsed.
  - Include `aria-controls` to associate expanded content with its corresponding control element.
  - These attributes will make the TOC more accessible for screen reader users, allowing them to navigate and interact with the TOC effectively.

## 2. Performance Enhancements

To ensure smooth performance, especially with large or deeply nested TOC structures, consider the following:

- **Lazy Loading**:
  - Load TOC nodes asynchronously as the user interacts with the component (e.g., expanding a section).
  - This reduces the initial load time for large TOC structures.
- **Virtual Scrolling**:
  - Render only the visible portion of the TOC at any given time, dynamically adding and removing items as the user scrolls.
  - This will optimize performance for TOCs with a large number of nested sections.

## 3. Additional Features

To enhance the functionality and user experience of the TOC component, consider adding these extra features:

- **Collapse All Expanded Nodes**:
  - Add a "Collapse All" button to allow users to close all expanded sections at once.
  - This simple but effective feature helps users reset the TOC after exploring multiple levels.
  
- **Highlighted Sections**:
  - Introduce a block to highlight important or frequently accessed sections (e.g., starred or bookmarked items).
  - The exact design of this feature can depend on the specific use case of the TOC.

- **Search/Filter Functionality**:
  - Add a search bar to filter TOC nodes based on user input.
  - Display only the nodes that match the search term, with the option to clear the filter and show all nodes if no matches are found.
  - Include a message for the user when no results are found.
